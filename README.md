# Toxic-Comment-Classifier

This is a project on Toxic comment Classification Using Machine Learning and the Model used is Multinomial Naive Bayes
This inititation is used as an alternate for Deep Learning Models That either cause Oversampling problems and High computational cost
This mainly uses SMOTE to reduce Oversampling
